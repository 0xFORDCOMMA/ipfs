# Contributing to IPFS

There are many ways to contribute to IPFS development. This document will flesh those out in time. For now,


### Help with the design

If you find an error or have a suggestion for the overall design of IPFS, please submit an Issue.

### Help with the implementations

Please contribute to the various [implementations](README.md#implementations) under development, or start another!

### Help with spreading the word

Please tweet, email, tell everyone about this. IPFS will succeed only if many people use it and build on it.

### Help in other ways

Email me directly if you'd like to help in other ways.
