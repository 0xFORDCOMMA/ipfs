# Contributing to IPFS

There are many ways to contribute to IPFS development. This document will flesh those out in time. For now,


### Help with the design

If you find an error or have a suggestion for the overall design of IPFS, please submit an [Issue](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs/issues/new).

If you have an error with an [implementation](README.md#implementations), file an issue in the respective repository. If you have an issue with the abstracted design, you can also check [specs](https://github.com/ipfs/specs). This repository is a landing repository for IPFS in general, and where any big updates will be posted.

### Help with the implementations

Please contribute to the various [implementations](README.md#implementations) under development, or start another!

### Help with spreading the word

Please tweet, email, tell everyone about this. IPFS will succeed only if many people use it and build on it.

### Help in other ways

[Email me directly](mailto:juan@ipfs.io?subject=Contributing to IPFS) if you'd like to help in other ways.
