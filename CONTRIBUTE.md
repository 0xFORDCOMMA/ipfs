# Contributing to IPFS

There are many ways to contribute to IPFS development. This document will flesh those out in time. For now,

### Necesary "we sadly live in a draconian world" notice:

Please note that IPFS is Open Source and all idea contributions made (ideas + work) will be taken as Open Source contributions.

To make sure we all abide by these rules, I've setup a [Contributor's License Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) that you should sign before contributing to this repository. I am not a lawyer, and am new to all the legal concerns here, so if anything rubs you the wrong way, please let me know by direct email or by opening an issue.


### Help with the design

If you find an error or have a suggestion for the overall design of IPFS, please submit an Issue.

### Help with the implementations

Please contribute to the various [implementations](README.md#implementations) under development, or start another!

### Help with spreading the word

Please tweet, email, tell everyone about this. IPFS will succeed only if many people use it and build on it.

### Help in other ways

Email me directly if you'd like to help in other ways.
